Predicting Customer Reorders: Data-Driven Sales Optimization EPA SALES

Abstract
Environmental Products & Accessories, LLC (EPA Sales) is a manufacturer and reseller of
vacuum truck parts. Despite its industry presence, EPA Sales currently lacks outbound sales
efforts, limiting its ability to anticipate customer needs and encourage repeat purchases. This
project aims to predict customer reorders and reorder timing while identifying high-value
customer segments to inform sales and marketing strategies.

Using historical 2024 transaction data, we applied K-Means Clustering to refine customer
segmentation based on purchasing behavior, Random Forest to determine feature importance and
predict if a customer will repurchase within 30 days, association rule mining to look for
interesting and useful relationships between items, and the Cox Proportional Hazards model to
estimate the likelihood and timing of future purchases.

We analyzed join-level customer, transaction, and product data to uncover purchase behaviors,
product performance patterns, and time-based trends. Using K-means clustering, we identified
three customer segments with distinct spend and frequency profiles; a random forest classifier
(AUC > 95%) effectively predicted 30-day reorders; association rule mining revealed
complementary product bundles; and a Cox proportional hazards model highlighted a critical
repurchase window within 50 days. Our findings inform segmentation-driven marketing,
inventory optimization, and early lifecycle outreach strategies to boost retention and revenue.
